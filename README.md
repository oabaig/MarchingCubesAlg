This is a research project I am currently working on supervised by Dr. David Mayerich and Dr. Guoning Chen from the University of Houston's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Computer Science Department respectively.

The goal of the project is to link the Virtual Toolkit library with Unreal Engine to create high-quality medical images for use in virtual reality.
